# UNR-thesis-template

A template repository for creating theses that adhere to [UNR thesis formatting requirements](https://www.unr.edu/grad/student-resources/filing-guidelines).

By setting the target of bookdown to `docs`, you can utilize github-pages to [view the html version](https://schisslergroup.github.io/UNR-thesis-template/) of this repo online!

The pdf also gets created and added to the docs folder. When viewing the paper online, there should be a pdf button at the top that allows you to download the PDF.
